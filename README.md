# Depo Platform — Overview of Depo Blockchain and Depo Finance

*(Note: This repository is under active development)*

Depo Platform consists of: 1) Depo Secure privacy preserving smart contract system 2) Depo Blockchain and 3) Depo Finance 

# Depo Secure 
https://github.com/DepoPlatform/DepoSecure  
Keep storage variable data private, accessible only to authorized parties, while preserving immutability, decentralization, and fairness of blockchain smart contracts.


Zero Knowledge Homomorphic based encyrption system to keep state variables private for onchain smart contracts. Fully compatible with EVM and Solidity stack. Easy implemenation and integration with existing smart contract systems with annotation based development process. 


# Depo Blockchain — Layer 2/3 Rollup Blockchain optimized for Liquid Staking Derivatives

With the launch of Depo Blockchain, the Depo Platform consists of a full stack of applications, from a sovereign layer2/3 EVM equivalent rollup blockchain (Depo Blockchain) to a user-facing all-in-one DeFi/NFT platform (Depo Finance).
Depo Blockchain

Depo Blockchain is a layer 2/3 sovereign rollup blockchain with special features tailored for Decentralized Finance of liquid staking assets. The Depo Blockchain is built on rollup stack with IBC cross blockchain messaging functionality. Thus, Depo Blockchain is able to operate both as a Cosmos hub and an EVM equivalent blockchain.
DeFi and NFT applications and money lego data types can be built on Depo Blockchain to access cross chain leverage and liquidity either through IBC or Gravity Bridge. The Depo Blockchain facilitates interoperability through Inter Blockchain Communication module with other blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem. For Ethereum and other blockchains with probabilistic finality, Depo Blockchain utilizes Gravity Bridge to offer interoperability.

Depo Blockchain is able to effectively function as a Ethereum/EVM parallel chain with full interoperability of Solidity smart contracts. Depo Blockchain also offers tremendous advantages to DeFi and NFT applications with much lower transactions fee and much faster finality.

The Depo Blockchain is the bedrock of cross chain interoperability to Depo users. It also offers great value to DeFi and NFT developers and applications with its lower transactions, higher throughput, and faster finality.

# Depo Finance

While the Depos Blockchain offers the bedrock of cross chain interoperability to the Depo Platform, equally important is the user facing Depo Finance application. While the Depo Blockchain is mainly used by the Depo team and other DeFi development teams to deliver innovative DeFi applications. Depo Finance is the all-in-one Cross Chain DeFi Platform intended for our users.

Depo Finance offers three major values to users:

Cross-chain DeFi and NFT services on one user interface: this allows users to capture opportunities on multiple blockchains and even perform lending and staking across blockchains using native chain assets.

Tiered Risk Management: Depo Finance offers users pools with different risk profiles for the same underlying transactions. Users may choose to invest in the same underlying protocol and services in principal protection pools or high yielding pools.

Secondary Liquidity and Derivatives Trading for Liquid Staking Assets: many public blockchains, such as Ethereum 2.0 offer users staking opportunities as part of the POS consensus mechanism. Many of these POS staking programs require large amounts of the underlying crypto assets to qualify and require an extensive period of time for staking. Users may not withdraw from such staking programs at will at any time. Depo Finance offers users POS staking pool services that allow users to easily join staking pools with small amounts of crypto assets and withdraw from POS staking pools at any time through market adjustment mechanisms. Users gain secondary liquidity through Depo Finance’s POS staking services.

# Depo Platform — Ecosystem

With the invited testnet launch of the Depo Blockchain and the continued refinement of Depo Finance, the Depo Platform becomes a full-stack ecosystem of blockchain foundational layer and user-facing decentralized DeFi applications.

Through Depo Blockchain, assets and liquidity can be accessed across multiple blockchains. While Depo Finance offers users an all-in-one and friendly user experience in access DeFi services within the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems and beyond.
